# grammarly
> Grammarly API interface.

[![CI](https://github.com/emacs-grammarly/grammarly/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emacs-grammarly/grammarly/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## üî® Examples

Below is an simple example that how you can use this library for calling
Grammarly API interface.

```el
(require 'grammarly)

(defun test-on-message (data)
  "On message callback with DATA."
  (message "[DATA] %s" data))

;; Set callback for receiving data.
(add-to-list 'grammarly-on-message-function-list 'test-on-message)

;; Send check text request.
(grammarly-check-text "Hello World")
```

## üí∏ Using a Paid Grammarly Account

You will need the set the following variable in order to use paid version
of Grammarly!

```el
(setq grammarly-username "username@email.com")  ; Your Grammarly Username
(setq grammarly-password "password")  ; Your Grammarly Password
```

If you use `auth-source` to manage your secrets, you can add this to your
`.authinfo.gpg` file:

``` 
machine grammarly.com login <your@email.com> pass <your-password>
```

And instead of directly setting `grammarly-username` and `grammarly-password`, 
you can call the helper function `grammarly-load-from-authinfo`.

``` el
(grammarly-load-from-authinfo)

;; Or, if you have multiple Grammarly accounts:
(grammarly-load-from-authinfo "your@email.com")
```
